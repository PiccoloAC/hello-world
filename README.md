# hello-world
Introductory project on GitHub
Hello World! I am returning to the software development world after taking a break to focus on my kids. A lot of new technology has emerged in the last few years that I need to come up to speed on. I have a lot of experience in what I would call "traditional" development projects (military, utility applications, etc). I am excited to apply my knowledge and experience to learning more about Java script, web-development and the cloud.
